# Slackforce

Slackforce is an Android App to measure and calculate forces in a Slackline. The App 
has the following three main functionalities:

1. Measuring the pretension of the slackline from the sound you get when slapping the line with the finger
2. Calculating the forces on the line at static conditions from the geometric properties
3. Calculating the Forces involved in dynamic moves like bouncing and jumping with a simulation of the slackliners movement

If you want to know more about the theoretical background you should have a look at:

Note that there might be errors in the calculations or the App. You should never only trust the calculated values, but
always check the values for reasonability. The creator of the App is not responsible of any harm resulting from the use
of the calculated values.

## Get the App
